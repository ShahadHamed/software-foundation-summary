1. Front-End (Client-side)

Definition: The front-end is what users directly see and interact with in their web browser or app interface.

Responsibilities:

User Interface (UI): Displaying the layout, buttons, forms, menus, graphics, etc.

User Experience (UX): Ensuring interactions are smooth, intuitive, and responsive.

Client-side logic: Handling interactions like form validation, animations, or dynamic updates without refreshing the page.

Communication with backend: Sending requests (like API calls) to the backend and displaying the response.

Technologies commonly used:

HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Frameworks/libraries: React, Angular, Vue.js, Svelte

Example: When you click “Submit” on a form, the front-end collects the data and sends it to the server.

2. Back-End (Server-side)

Definition: The back-end is the part of the application that runs on the server and handles business logic, processing, and integration with databases.

Responsibilities:

Processing requests: Receives requests from the front-end, processes them, and returns responses.

Business logic: Handles calculations, rules, and workflows of the application.

Authentication & authorization: Verifying user identity and controlling access.

Integration: Communicating with databases, external APIs, or other services.

Data validation and security: Ensuring input data is safe and meets requirements before storing or processing.

Technologies commonly used:

Languages: Java, Python, JavaScript (Node.js), Ruby, PHP, Go

Frameworks: Express.js, Django, Spring Boot, Ruby on Rails

Example: After receiving your login credentials, the backend checks if they match a record in the database and returns a “success” or “error” response.

3. Database

Definition: The database is where all the application’s data is stored and managed.

Responsibilities:

Data storage: Keeping structured or unstructured data safely.

Data retrieval: Allowing the backend to fetch or query data efficiently.

Data integrity: Ensuring relationships and constraints are maintained.

Data security: Controlling access to sensitive data.

Transactions & backups: Managing consistent updates and storing backups to prevent data loss.

Types of databases:

Relational databases (SQL): MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server

Non-relational databases (NoSQL): MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra

Example: When the backend checks your login credentials, it queries the database for a matching user record.

How they work together

User (Front-End) → clicks a button or submits a form.

Front-End → sends the request to the Back-End.

Back-End → processes the request, queries the Database, applies business logic.

Database → returns the requested data to the Back-End.

Back-End → sends processed data back to the Front-End.

Front-End → displays the data to the user.
